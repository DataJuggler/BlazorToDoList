Update 9.23.2019: This release works really well, and was created using DataTier.Net version 2.0.11 which now works with Dot Net Core
and has built in features for Blazor.

To run this sample:

Create a SQL Server database named BlazorList.

Execute the script in the SQL Folder BlazorList Tables And Procedures.sql

Build a connection string to the new BlazorList database you just created.

Tip: DataTier.Net comes with a connection string builder program in the Tools folder:
https://github.com/DataJuggler/DataTier.Net

Create a System Environment Variable named BlazorToDoConnection and set the value to the connectionstring from the previous step.

Run the program and click on the To Do List menu option.

Add, Edit and Delete To Do items.

I am building a tutorial and video now for how I bulit this.

Enjoy
